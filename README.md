So this is my first "assignment" on The Odin Project.

Recreate the Google Homepage.

Can't wait to do it...maybe reimagine it a little bit.

### After completion thoughts go down here:
So i finished the homepage and also did the "hard" assignment, the search results page (which was harder in the sense of multiple elements and styling)

I know my way around a html/css page, know how to edit such files, use developer mode in chrome/firefox and search for solutions. So at first, when i saw this assignment thought "That is easy. Should i even botter or just skip it?". But now after... let's say... 4h of total time spent on this, i realize i don't know that much about building a page from scratch, and it was a good refresh for my almost skills.

That means it was a good exercise and altough i did not style the pages to match exactly the original, i'm glad i made it look kinda like it.

For now i'll call this assignment DONE and can't wait to read this and the code again in a couple of months and realize how bad i was and how much easier and better i could've coded it. But until then i'm still a noob. And noobs gotta learn.

### What i learned:
- how to list
- how to use a sprite
- elements positioning...kinda - much more to learn
- Div's, ID's and classes
- margins, paddings

Peace out!
